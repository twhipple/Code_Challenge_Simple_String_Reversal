## Simple String Reversal

In this Repo I will attempt to code one of the CodeWars Katas - Simple String Reversal.  Although, there is a trick! It's not as simple as it seems because in this challenge, I need to preserve the placement of the spaces!

We are going to reverse a string while maintaining the spaces (if any) in their original place.


## Examples:

### 1
solve("our code") = "edo cruo"

-- Normal reversal without spaces is "edocruo". 

-- However, there is a space at index 3, so the string becomes "edo cruo"

### 2
solve("your code rocks") = "skco redo cruoy". 

### 3
solve("codewars") = "srawedoc"

More examples in the test cases. 


## Additionally

All input will be lower case letters and in some cases spaces.
